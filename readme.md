# Aurora

Aurora is a game about space colonization, artificial intelligence, and eschatology.

This project is lead by Grace Rarer as part of Georgia Tech's VGDev club.

## How to build and run locally

To build the project, run `build.sh` from bash.

To test the program locally, you need to start a local server and then navigate to `http://localhost:<port#>/index.html`. I've provided a small script, `runlocal.sh`, to do this for you. To make it work, you'll need to install `live-server` using Node: `npm install live-server -g`.

You can also build and launch the local server in one command: `./build.sh -r`
